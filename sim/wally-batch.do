# Example: do wally-batch.do rv32imc imperas-32i

# Use this wally-batch.do file to run this example.
# Either bring up ModelSim and type the following at the "ModelSim>" prompt:
#     do wally-batch.do
# or, to run from a shell, type the following at the shell prompt:
#     vsim -do wally-batch.do -c
